    <h1 style="color:white;"> The game that my group and I worked on was a clciker game, we referened our game towards cookie clicker, aim trainer, and cps(clickers per second game). We all seeperated the work evenly I worked on debugging and the overall game idea, alos the conents of whats happening within each code. The objective of the game is to have good aim/ mouse movemnt and tracking, and try to get the most amount of clicks within 10 secounds with the fastest amount of clicks you can possibly do. There is no real objective other than getting high amount of clicks and beating your personal best. I personally got 101 clicks </h1>
